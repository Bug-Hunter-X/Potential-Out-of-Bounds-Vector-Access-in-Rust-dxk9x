This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing vector elements with potentially out-of-bounds indices. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The bug is a potential panic due to accessing an index that may be out of the vector's bounds.  The solution incorporates error handling to gracefully deal with invalid indices.
